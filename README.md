üöÄ Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Google Cloud API key for Gemini
pip package manager

Step 1: Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/HackIndia-Spark-9-2025-SolArise.git
cd HackIndia-Spark-9-2025-SolArise
Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:
envGOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
Step 5: Prepare Vector Store
Ensure you have a vectorstore.pkl file in the root directory containing your processed legal documents.
‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Google Gemini API Setup

Go to Google AI Studio
Create a new API key
Add it to your .env file (never hardcode in source files!)

Vector Store Configuration
The system expects a pickled vector store file (vectorstore.pkl) containing preprocessed legal documents. You can modify the loading path in chat_engine.py:
pythondef load_vectorstore(path: str = "vectorstore.pkl"):
    with open(path, "rb") as f:
        return pickle.load(f)
üéÆ Usage
Running the Application
bashpython app.py
The application will start on http://localhost:5000 in debug mode.
Command Line Interface
You can also run the chat engine directly:
bashpython chat_engine.py
Using the Web Interface

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000
Type your legal question in the text area
Click the send button or press Enter
View the AI-generated response based on legal document context

Example Queries

"What are the requirements for filing a property dispute?"
"Explain the process of company registration in India"
"What are the rights of consumers under Indian law?"

üîß Customization
Modifying the AI Model
You can change the Gemini model in chat_engine.py:
pythongemini_model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model="gemini-1.5-pro",  # Change to gemini-1.5-pro for better performance
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1000  # Increase for longer responses
)
Updating the Prompt Template
Modify the prompt template in chat_engine.py to customize AI behavior:
pythonprompt_template = """
You are a specialized legal assistant for Indian law...
# Add your custom instructions here
"""
Styling Customization
The CSS in chat.html uses CSS variables for easy theme customization:

Primary colors: #7e5bc2 (purple), #10a37f (teal)
Gradient backgrounds with smooth animations
Responsive design for mobile compatibility
